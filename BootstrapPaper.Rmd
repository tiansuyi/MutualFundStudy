A Bootstrap Study of Mutual Fund
=================================
Preface-Opinions from the first section
---------------------------------
1.Perform a study on mutual fund to see whether the prolonged superior performance of some funds is purely luck.

2.Genuine stock-picking skills or persisting luck(or can luck persist?how to exam?).

3.The question of this paper:With mutual fund alphas that deviate significantly from normality,how many funds from a large group would we expect to exhibit high alphas simply due to luck,and how does this figure compare to the number we actually observe?

4.The key of their study is the bootstrap analysis that allows them to precisely separate luck from skill in the complicated nonnormal cross section of ranked mutual fund alphas.(?)

5.net-of-cost vs pre-cost.

6.Study of persistence is similar to Cahart(1997).

7.Identifying funds with significant skills and somewhat decreasing returns-to scale in managers' talents.

Bootstrapping Procedure
-------------------------------------------------
### A1.Individual Munual Funds Alphas

Bootstrap can improve the nonnormalize thing

### A2.Cross Section of Mutual Fund Alphas

A lot of factors(such as heterogeneity and individual distribution) leads to the bootstrap a best method.

### B.Implementation

two models

两个线性模型（MD怎么打公式）

### B1.baseline bootstrap procedure:residual sampling

首先：对数据OLS估计

固定i对OLS的残差panel重抽样，生成pseudo-time series

再替换model中的残差，同时set alpha=0，重新生成收益率数据

上述步骤重复1000遍，看新的收益率数据分布

把生成的与实际的相比：如果二者差很远，就认为是skill ，rather than luck.
